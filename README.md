# FPCN_Heterogeneity


FC values used for many analyses are included in the excel file.

Text files labeled with condition names (e.g., Rest) were used to construct spring embedded visualizations in Pajek

Text files with parcellation names (e.g., Yeo within) reflect group and condition averaged FC subgraphs that were used in the hierarchical clustering analyses. Within = within FPCN FC values. Between = FPCN - DN and DAN FC values.
